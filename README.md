PERSONAL FINANCE TRACKER AND BUDGET PLANNER
Problem Statement
In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, many individuals find it challenging to manage their personal finances effectively. Without structured budgeting skills or clear tracking mechanisms, expenses often spiral out of control. Impulsive spending habits, neglected savings, and lack of visibility into where money is being spent can lead to financial stress and instability. Many people, including students, working professionals, freelancers, and families, struggle to maintain a balance between spending on needs, wants, and savings. The absence of a proper financial plan often results in overspending in categories like food, entertainment, and shopping, while crucial areas like savings or essential expenses are overlooked.

Solution
The Personal Finance Tracker & Budgeting Web App is designed to empower users by giving them complete control over their financial habits. It enables users to:

Track Income and Expenses: Users can categorize transactions under labels like food, rent, groceries, transportation, entertainment, etc.

Set Budgets: Based on their income and personal spending patterns, users can set realistic monthly budgets for different categories.

Receive Spending Insights: The app provides smart alerts like "You're overspending on food this month!" to promote mindful spending.

Visualize Finances: Users can view detailed charts and reports that summarize their financial health at a glance.

Get Personalized Saving Tips: Based on the userâ€™s spending behavior, the app suggests actionable saving strategies.

Plan Financial Goals: Whether saving for a vacation, buying a new car, or building an emergency fund, users can set and track progress towards financial goals.
